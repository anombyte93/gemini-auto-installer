- Save your API key securely as `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`:
  - **Linux/WSL:** ~/.bashrc
  - **macOS:** ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
- Create Open Codex configuration at `~/.codex/config.json`
- Test the installation

### Step 4: Activate the Installation

Reload your terminal configuration:

**Linux/WSL:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**macOS:**
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
# OR if using bash:
source ~/.bash_profile
```

3. If NO ‚Üí System explains why docs are important and sends you back
4. If YES ‚Üí System helps you build an AI prompt to complement the docs

**Example:**
```
You: Select "Install Software" ‚Üí Choose "Docker"
System: "Have you checked Docker's official installation docs? (y/n)"
You: n
System: "Please check https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ first!
        This ensures you understand Docker's requirements and
        recommended installation method. Come back after reading!"
        [Returns to menu]

You: [Reads docs, comes back]
You: Select "Install Software" ‚Üí Choose "Docker"
System: "Have you checked Docker's official installation docs? (y/n)"
You: y
System: "Great! Now let's use AI to help with the installation..."
```

## üéØ How to Use Open Codex as Your Auto-Installer

### Usage Modes

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
open-codex
```
Starts an interactive session where you can have a conversation with the AI.

**Direct Prompting:**
```bash
open-codex "Your prompt here"
```
Send a one-off prompt and get a response.

**With Specific Provider:**
```bash
open-codex --provider gemini "Your prompt here"
```

### Example 1: Install Suricata with Wazuh Integration

This is the main use case for cybersecurity students:

```bash
open-codex "Install Suricata IDS on this Ubuntu system that has a Wazuh agent already installed. Configure Suricata to log network traffic to /var/log/suricata/ and integrate it with the Wazuh agent by configuring the ossec.conf file to monitor Suricata's eve.json logs. Enable all ET Open rulesets and configure network interface monitoring. Show me the exact commands to run."
```

**What happens:**
1. Gemini analyzes your request
2. Generates installation commands for Ubuntu
3. Provides configuration steps
4. Shows integration commands for Wazuh

**You then:**
1. Read the commands to understand what they do
2. Copy and paste them into your terminal
3. Execute them one by one (or as a script)

### Example 2: Install Docker

```bash
open-codex "Install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04 and add my current user to the docker group so I can run docker without sudo. Show me the commands."
```

### Example 3: Configure Suricata Performance

```bash
open-codex "Configure Suricata to use 4 CPU threads and enable all protocol analyzers. Show me what to edit in suricata.yaml"
```

### Example 4: Troubleshoot Errors

If something goes wrong:

```bash
open-codex "I got this error when starting Suricata: [paste your error here]. How do I fix it?"
```

---

## üí° Tips for Getting Good Results

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Be specific** - Mention your OS version (Ubuntu 22.04, etc.)
- **Mention existing software** - "I already have Wazuh agent installed"
- **Ask for commands** - "Show me the exact commands to run"
- **Request explanations** - "Explain what each command does"

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Be too vague - "Install security stuff"
- Forget to mention your environment
- Skip reading the commands before running them

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tasks for Cybersecurity Students
