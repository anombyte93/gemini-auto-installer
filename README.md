**AI-powered code CLI that helps you install and configure software through simple prompts.**

Use Open Codex with Google Gemini AI to automatically install Suricata, Wazuh, Docker, and other tools by just describing what you need.

**‚úÖ Supports:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/RHEL/Fedora), macOS, WSL
**‚öôÔ∏è Requires:** Node.js v22+

---

## üìñ For Students: What is This?

This tool installs **Open Codex CLI** with **Google Gemini** on your system, which acts as your AI-powered coding assistant. Instead of following complex installation guides, you simply tell the AI what you want installed, and it generates the exact commands for you, with the ability to execute them interactively.

### üéì Student Mode (NEW!)

**Perfect for students who don't understand AI or feel lost using command-line tools!**

Student Mode is a simple wrapper that launches Open Codex with built-in learning instructions.

**What it does:**
- **üìö Auto-includes student learning context** - AI knows you're learning and explains accordingly
- **üí° Simple language** - AI uses beginner-friendly explanations automatically
- **üîí Safety reminders** - AI warns about dangerous commands (sudo, rm, etc.)
- **üìñ Documentation prompts** - AI reminds you to check official docs first
- **‚úÖ Verification steps** - AI includes steps to confirm things worked
- **üéì Explains WHY** - Not just commands, but understanding

**How it works:**
```bash
student-codex
```

This automatically launches Open Codex with this context:
- "I am a student learning system administration"
- "Explain concepts in simple terms"
- "Warn me about dangerous commands"
- "Remind me to check documentation first"
- "Provide step-by-step explanations"

**Want to bypass student mode?**
```bash
open-codex
```

This gives you direct access without the student learning prompts.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Students

### Step 1: Download the Installer Script

Download this repository to your system:

**For Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Clone with git
git clone https://github.com/anombyte93/gemini-auto-installer.git
cd gemini-auto-installer
```

**For Windows users:**
```bash
# Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
# Open Ubuntu/Debian WSL terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/anombyte93/gemini-auto-installer.git
cd gemini-auto-installer
```

**No git installed?**
- Go to: https://github.com/anombyte93/gemini-auto-installer
- Click "Code" ‚Üí "Download ZIP"
- Extract and open terminal in that folder

### Step 2: Get Your FREE Google Gemini API Key

./install-gemini-cli.sh
```

The script will:
- **Detect your operating system** (Linux/macOS)
- **Check Node.js version** (requires v22+):
  - If Node.js is not installed or too old, it will automatically install/upgrade to v22
  - **Linux:** via apt (Ubuntu/Debian) or yum (RHEL/Fedora)
  - **macOS:** via Homebrew (installs Homebrew first if needed)
- Install **Open Codex CLI** globally
- **Prompt you for your Gemini API key** - paste it when asked
- Save your API key securely as `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`:
  - **Linux/WSL:** ~/.bashrc
  - **macOS:** ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
- Create Open Codex configuration at `~/.codex/config.json`
- **Optionally install Student Mode** (recommended for beginners)
- **Optionally setup instructor SSH access** (if in a course)
- Test the installation

### Step 4: Activate the Installation

Reload your terminal configuration:

**Linux/WSL:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**macOS:**
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
# OR if using bash:
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Or simply close and reopen your terminal.

### Step 5: Test It Works

**For Students (Recommended):**
```bash
student-codex
```
This launches Student Mode with guided menus and tutorials.

**For Advanced Users:**
```bash
open-codex "Hello, are you working?"
```

If you get a response from Gemini, you're ready to go!

## üéØ How to Use Open Codex as Your Auto-Installer

### Usage Modes

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
open-codex
```
Starts an interactive session where you can have a conversation with the AI.

**Direct Prompting:**
```bash
open-codex "Your prompt here"
```
Send a one-off prompt and get a response.

**With Specific Provider:**
```bash
open-codex --provider gemini "Your prompt here"
```

### Example 1: Install Suricata with Wazuh Integration

This is the main use case for cybersecurity students:

```bash
open-codex "Install Suricata IDS on this Ubuntu system that has a Wazuh agent already installed. Configure Suricata to log network traffic to /var/log/suricata/ and integrate it with the Wazuh agent by configuring the ossec.conf file to monitor Suricata's eve.json logs. Enable all ET Open rulesets and configure network interface monitoring. Show me the exact commands to run."
```

**What happens:**
1. Gemini analyzes your request
2. Generates installation commands for Ubuntu
3. Provides configuration steps
4. Shows integration commands for Wazuh

**You then:**
1. Read the commands to understand what they do
2. Copy and paste them into your terminal
3. Execute them one by one (or as a script)

### Example 2: Install Docker

```bash
open-codex "Install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04 and add my current user to the docker group so I can run docker without sudo. Show me the commands."
```

### Example 3: Configure Suricata Performance

```bash
open-codex "Configure Suricata to use 4 CPU threads and enable all protocol analyzers. Show me what to edit in suricata.yaml"
```

### Example 4: Troubleshoot Errors

If something goes wrong:

```bash
open-codex "I got this error when starting Suricata: [paste your error here]. How do I fix it?"
```

---

## üí° Tips for Getting Good Results

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Be specific** - Mention your OS version (Ubuntu 22.04, etc.)
- **Mention existing software** - "I already have Wazuh agent installed"
- **Ask for commands** - "Show me the exact commands to run"
- **Request explanations** - "Explain what each command does"

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Be too vague - "Install security stuff"
- Forget to mention your environment
- Skip reading the commands before running them

   # Edit the file
   nano ~/.bashrc

   # Find and replace the GOOGLE_API_KEY line
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE"

   # Save and reload
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "open-codex: command not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# Or close and reopen your terminal
```

### Problem: "API key invalid" or "401 Unauthorized"

**Solution:** Get your own key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and update your `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# Find and update the line:
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE"
# Save and reload:
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Problem: "Node.js version too old" or "Requires Node.js v22+"

**Solution:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
