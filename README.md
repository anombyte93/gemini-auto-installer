# Gemini Auto-Installer

AI-powered auto-installer using Google Gemini CLI for automated software installation and configuration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Gemini CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-auto-installer/main/install-gemini-cli.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**OR clone and run locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-auto-installer.git
cd gemini-auto-installer
chmod +x install-gemini-cli.sh
./install-gemini-cli.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Use AI to Install Software

Simply describe what you want installed:

```bash
gemini "Install Suricata IDS on this Ubuntu system that has a Wazuh agent already installed. Configure Suricata to log network traffic to /var/log/suricata/ and integrate it with the Wazuh agent by configuring the ossec.conf file to monitor Suricata's eve.json logs. Enable all ET Open rulesets and configure network interface monitoring. Show me the exact commands to run."
```

The AI generates installation commands ‚Üí You copy-paste and execute ‚Üí Done!

## üéØ Use Cases

### Install Suricata with Wazuh Integration

```bash
gemini "Install Suricata IDS on this Ubuntu system that has a Wazuh agent already installed. Configure Suricata to log network traffic to /var/log/suricata/ and integrate it with the Wazuh agent by configuring the ossec.conf file to monitor Suricata's eve.json logs. Enable all ET Open rulesets and configure network interface monitoring. Show me the exact commands to run."
```

### Install Docker

```bash
gemini "Install Docker on Ubuntu and add my user to the docker group. Show me the commands."
```

### Configure Services

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Install Script** installs Node.js and Gemini CLI
2. **Configure** sets up the Google API key automatically
3. **Prompt** the AI with natural language descriptions of what you want installed
4. **Execute** the commands the AI generates
5. **Iterate** if errors occur, paste them back to the AI for fixes

## üéì For Educators

This tool is designed for cybersecurity and IT courses where students need to:

- Install and configure IDS/IPS systems (Suricata, Snort)
- Integrate security tools (Wazuh, OSSEC, Elastic Stack)
- Learn system administration through AI assistance
- Practice infrastructure-as-code concepts

Students learn by:
1. Describing requirements in natural language
2. Reviewing AI-generated commands
3. Understanding what each command does
4. Troubleshooting with AI assistance
